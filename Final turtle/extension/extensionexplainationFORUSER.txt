“TURTLE ON” or “TURTLE OFF”. Imagine the output window as a plane of existence and FD/LT/RT as directions for the user’s movement on said plane, with the user starting in the centre facing upwards. These two instruction pairings toggle a visual interpretation of the position of the user on the plane as a Red isosceles triangle pointing in the direction the user is pointing. It serves the benefit of allowing us to see the user’s facing.

“NODRAW ON” or “NODRAW OFF” give us the ability to move the user’s location on the plane without drawing a line if no draw is toggled. This allows a greater range of shapes and patterns to be drawn by a user. It conforms to the simple nature of the original formal grammar making it another instruction accessible to a child or first time user.
