Manual calculations for final turtle position of handouttest1.txt:
clearly final location is (0,0)
Final angle is 45 degrees of due north: 45 degrees from the x axis = 0.78 radians

Manual calculations for final turtle position of handouttest2.txt:
as above

Manual calculations for final turtle position of handouttest3.txt:
Using a recursive function for FD 1.5 -> 150 in increments of 1.5, turning 62 degrees each time: -93.8, 110.6 with an angle of 72.0 degrees

Manual calculations for final turtle position of handouttest4.txt:
Can ignore the circles it draws just do the spiral:
-64.6, 68.3 with angle 74.9 degrees.

Changes made in order to get all things to parse and produce the correct result:
	- when a Do loop went from numbers x to y where 0 was between x and y, we needed to add a modification to the loop in order to set the zero flag as the variable passes through zero.
