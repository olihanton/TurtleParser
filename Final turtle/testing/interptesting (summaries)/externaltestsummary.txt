N.B. that manual calculations angles are in degrees whereas the program’s calculated angle is in radians.
First three external test programs not written by me, but downloaded from GitHub. The last three were written prior to writing the interpreter so as to be truly blackbox.

Manual calculations for final turtle position of externaltest1.txt:
Using a recursive function for FD 1.5 -> 150 in increments of 1.5, turning 62 degrees each time: -93.8, 110.6 with an angle of 72.0 degrees - see handouttest3

Manual calculations for final turtle position of externaltest2.txt:
Can ignore the circles it draws just do the spiral:
-64.6, 68.3 with angle 74.9 degrees. - see handouttest4

Manual calculations for final turtle position of externaltest3.txt:
Gives location of 112.3, 71.3 and an angle of 84.8 degrees

Manual calculations for final turtle position of externaltest4.txt:
In the range of -50 and -1 with a facing of 106 degrees (quick calculation)
Actually: (-50.7, -2.9, 106) - significantly close.

Manual calculations for final turtle position of externaltest5.txt:
Much easier to calculate:
-2152.7, -1432.2, at -109 degrees

Manual calculations for final turtle position of externaltest6.txt:
-25, 15.78, at -35 degrees
